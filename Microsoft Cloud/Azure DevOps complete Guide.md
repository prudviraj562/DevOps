1. Explain Azure Boards in Azure DevOps?

**Azure Boards** is a tool for planning, tracking, and managing work using Agile, Scrum, or Kanban methodologies. 
It provides visual boards, backlogs, and dashboards to streamline project workflows and enhance team collaboration.

-- A Kanban Board is a visual tool to manage workflow, showing tasks as cards that move across columns representing stages
   like To Do, In Progress, and Done. It helps teams visualize work, limit tasks in progress, and identify bottlenecks for smoother, more efficient workflows.

   Example:
     To Do	     In Progress	      Done
     Task A	       Task B	         Task C

-- A Scrum Board is a visual tool used in the Scrum methodology to track the progress of work during a sprint.
  It helps Scrum teams organize and prioritize tasks, ensuring timely delivery within the sprint cycle.

  Example:
     Backlog	    To Do	      In Progress	   Testing	   Done
     Feature A	  Bug #123	   Feature B	   Feature C	 Bug #124

-- **Agile**: A project management methodology focused on delivering value through iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability to change. It emphasizes small, incremental releases for continuous improvement.

-- **Scrum**: A framework under Agile that organizes work into fixed-length sprints with defined roles and ceremonies to achieve iterative progress. It promotes team collaboration and accountability.

-- **Kanban**: A visual workflow management method emphasizing continuous delivery, limiting work in progress (WIP), and optimizing task flow without fixed iterations. It adapts to changing priorities dynamically.

-- **DevOps**: A culture and practice that integrates development and operations teams to automate, monitor, and improve software delivery and infrastructure management. It focuses on collaboration, CI/CD, and rapid feedback loops.

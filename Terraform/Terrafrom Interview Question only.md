# Terraform Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. Terraform workflow ?
1. Init (Initialize the Working Directory): The terraform init command initializes your Terraform working directory
- **Downloads Providers**: Terraform downloads the necessary plugins (providers) for the
resources you're defining in your code. In your case, since you're using the local provider,
Terraform will download the necessary plugin for local file operations.
- **Creates State File**: Terraform creates a state file (**terraform.tfstate**) to track the current
state of your infrastructure. This file is crucial for Terraform to understand what's already
deployed and what needs to be changed.
- **Sets Up Backend**: If you're using a remote backend (like Google Cloud Storage or AWS
S3) to store your state file, terraform init will configure the backend connection.
2. Plan (Preview Changes) : Terraform code and creates an execution
plan, It shows you what changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure 
**Output**: The terraform plan command will output a detailed plan, including:
- Resources to Create: Lists the resources that will be created.
- Resources to Update: Lists the resources that will be updated.
- Resources to Destroy: Lists the resources that will be destroyed.
3. Apply (Apply Changes) : It makes the actual changes to your infrastructure
**Output**: 
- Resources Created: Lists the resources that were created.
- Resources Updated: Lists the resources that were updated.
- Resources Destroyed: Lists the resources that were destroyed.
4. Destroy (Clean Up Resources) : The terraform destroy command removes the resources that were created by
Terraform.
## 2. Terraform Command Lines
**Format and Validate Terraform code**
- terraform fmt #format code per HCL canonical standard
- terraform validate #validate code for syntax
- terraform validate -backend=false #validate code skip backend validation
**Initialize your Terraform working directory**
- terraform init #initialize directory, pull down providers
- terraform init -get-plugins=false #initialize directory, do not download plugins
- terraform init -verify-plugins=false #initialize directory, do not verify plugins for Hashicorp

## 3.What is a null_resource?
- Here, the null_resource allows you to run a command using the command line interface (CLI) within your Terraform workflow without deploying any resources. The provisioner local-exec runs the command on your machine, and the command argument specifies what to execute. Here, it’s an echo command, but it could be a script or any other command.
```
resource "null_resource" "local_7635" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo 'Executing a one-time task with null_resource'"
  }
}
---
resource "null_resource" "run_bucket_terraform" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "cd bucket && terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "terrateam_in" {
  ami           = "ami-0e86e20dae9224db8"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = "subnet-02efa144df0a77c13"
  depends_on    = [null_resource.run_bucket_terraform]
}
```


## 2. Best Practices for Managing Secrets in Terraform
- Use `terraform-provider-vault` for secure storage.
- Leverage environment variables (`TF_VAR_`) to pass sensitive data.
- Avoid storing secrets in `.tfstate` by using remote backends like S3 with encryption.

## 3. Difference between `count` and `for_each`
- `count` works with integer values and is useful for creating multiple identical resources.
- `for_each` works with maps or sets and is more flexible for creating resources based on dynamic collections.

## 4. Managing Resource Dependencies
Terraform automatically manages dependencies via resource references. Explicit dependencies can be defined using the `depends_on` argument.

## 5. Terraform State Management
State tracks resource mappings to real-world infrastructure. It’s crucial for knowing the desired vs. actual infrastructure and preventing drift.

## 6. Role of Providers in Terraform
Providers are responsible for API communication with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure). They enable resource provisioning, modification, and destruction.

## 7. Parallelism in Terraform
Use the `-parallelism` flag during `terraform apply` to increase or limit the number of concurrent operations, improving performance in large environments.

## 8. Remote Backends
Remote backends (e.g., S3, Azure Blob) store state remotely, enabling team collaboration, locking, and enhanced state security across environments.

## 9. Managing Terraform Modules at Scale
- Organize reusable modules in version-controlled repositories.
- Follow a consistent module structure and documentation.
- Use `terraform registry` for versioning and distribution.

## 10. Preventing Concurrent Modifications
Remote backends (like S3 with DynamoDB or Azure Blob with locks) support state locking, preventing multiple users from changing the state simultaneously.

## 11. `local-exec` vs `remote-exec` Provisioners
- `local-exec`: Executes scripts on the machine where Terraform is run.
- `remote-exec`: Executes commands inside the created resource (e.g., a VM).

## 12. Securing Terraform State Across Teams
- Store state in a secure remote backend.
- Use state encryption and access controls (e.g., IAM policies in AWS).
- Enable state locking to prevent conflicts.

## 13. Difference Between `taint` and `import`
- `taint`: Marks a resource for recreation on the next `terraform apply`.
- `import`: Brings existing resources into Terraform management without recreating them.

## 14. Detecting and Addressing Drift
Run `terraform plan` frequently to detect drift between the actual and desired state, and use `terraform apply` to fix it.

## 15. Best Practices for Organizing Terraform Configurations
- Use modules for reusable components.
- Keep environment-specific values in variable files (`.tfvars`).
- Separate state files per environment using workspaces or remote backends.

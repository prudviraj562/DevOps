1. State File Management and Recovery

Scenario: You are working on a project, and suddenly the Terraform state file is corrupted or lost. How would you recover from this situation?


2. Handling Sensitive Information

Scenario: Your Terraform configuration requires sensitive information such as database passwords and API keys. What measures would you take to securely handle these secrets in your infrastructure code?


3. Module Versioning

Scenario: You’ve created a Terraform module used across multiple environments, and you need to update the module for new functionality without breaking existing environments. How do you handle module versioning in Terraform?


4. Multi-Environment Management

Scenario: You are tasked with deploying infrastructure across multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) using Terraform. How would you structure your code and manage different environment-specific configurations?


5. State Locking and Concurrency

Scenario: Two team members try to apply Terraform changes at the same time, causing a state file conflict. How does Terraform handle such situations, and what can you do to prevent this?


6. Managing Drift in Infrastructure

Scenario: After deploying your infrastructure using Terraform, someone manually makes changes in the cloud provider console. How would you identify and rectify such changes to ensure consistency with your Terraform code?


7. Terraform Backend Migration

Scenario: You’re using a local backend for Terraform, and now you need to migrate your state to an S3 bucket for centralized state management. How would you migrate the backend without disrupting the existing infrastructure?


8. Managing Terraform Workspaces

Scenario: You are managing multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) and have been advised to use Terraform workspaces. How would you explain the role of workspaces and implement them to manage environment-specific state?


9. Splitting Large Terraform Projects

Scenario: Your Terraform codebase has grown significantly large, and managing all infrastructure in a single configuration file has become unmanageable. How would you break down your Terraform configuration into smaller, more manageable pieces?

1. State Management

Scenario: You’ve been working on a Terraform project with a remote backend. Your team accidentally deleted the Terraform state file. How would you recover it, and what precautions should you take to avoid such issues in the future?

Concepts: Terraform state, remote backend, state file recovery, state locking, backup strategies.


2. Handling Resource Drift

Scenario: Your infrastructure has drifted from the Terraform configuration. How would you identify and reconcile the drift using Terraform?

Concepts: Terraform plan, refresh, resource drift, reconciliation strategies, Terraform state file synchronization.


3. Managing Sensitive Data

Scenario: How would you handle sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or certificates in your Terraform configuration?

Concepts: Environment variables, Terraform var files, AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, encryption, sensitive variables in Terraform.


4. Multi-Environment Setup

Scenario: You are managing multiple environments (dev, staging, production) using Terraform. How would you structure your configuration to handle this setup efficiently?

Concepts: Workspaces, environment-specific variables, folder structure, reusability with modules, remote backend per environment.


5. Terraform Modules

Scenario: Your team wants to reuse a complex configuration (e.g., VPC setup, RDS instance) across multiple projects. How would you implement this with Terraform?

Concepts: Terraform modules, reusability, inputs and outputs, module registry, best practices for structuring modules.


6. Provisioning and Rollbacks

Scenario: You’ve provisioned infrastructure using Terraform, but a bug in your configuration caused downtime. How would you roll back to a previous working state?

Concepts: Terraform state versions, terraform apply rollback, manual state modification, version control practices.


7. Terraform with CI/CD

Scenario: You’re tasked with automating the infrastructure deployment process using Terraform in a CI/CD pipeline. How would you integrate Terraform in this pipeline?

Concepts: Automating Terraform in CI/CD, managing state remotely in pipelines, secret management in CI/CD tools, environment isolation.


8. Managing Large Infrastructure

Scenario: You’re managing a large-scale infrastructure with hundreds of resources. Applying changes takes a long time. How would you optimize this?

Concepts: Terraform graph, dependency resolution, terraform parallelism, resource targeting (terraform apply -target), state partitioning.

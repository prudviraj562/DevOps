1. State File Management and Recovery

Scenario: You are working on a project, and suddenly the Terraform state file is corrupted or lost. How would you recover from this situation?


2. Handling Sensitive Information

Scenario: Your Terraform configuration requires sensitive information such as database passwords and API keys. What measures would you take to securely handle these secrets in your infrastructure code?


3. Module Versioning

Scenario: You’ve created a Terraform module used across multiple environments, and you need to update the module for new functionality without breaking existing environments. How do you handle module versioning in Terraform?


4. Multi-Environment Management

Scenario: You are tasked with deploying infrastructure across multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) using Terraform. How would you structure your code and manage different environment-specific configurations?


5. State Locking and Concurrency

Scenario: Two team members try to apply Terraform changes at the same time, causing a state file conflict. How does Terraform handle such situations, and what can you do to prevent this?


6. Managing Drift in Infrastructure

Scenario: After deploying your infrastructure using Terraform, someone manually makes changes in the cloud provider console. How would you identify and rectify such changes to ensure consistency with your Terraform code?


7. Terraform Backend Migration

Scenario: You’re using a local backend for Terraform, and now you need to migrate your state to an S3 bucket for centralized state management. How would you migrate the backend without disrupting the existing infrastructure?


8. Managing Terraform Workspaces

Scenario: You are managing multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) and have been advised to use Terraform workspaces. How would you explain the role of workspaces and implement them to manage environment-specific state?


9. Splitting Large Terraform Projects

Scenario: Your Terraform codebase has grown significantly large, and managing all infrastructure in a single configuration file has become unmanageable. How would you break down your Terraform configuration into smaller, more manageable pieces?

1. Service Discovery in a Cluster

How would you set up communication between multiple microservices within the same Kubernetes cluster? How does Kubernetes manage service discovery for internal services?



2. Rolling Updates and Rollbacks

You’ve deployed a new version of an application, but it’s causing issues. Describe how you would perform a rollback in Kubernetes and what mechanisms exist to ensure zero downtime during deployments.



3. Managing Configurations and Secrets

Your application requires sensitive data like API keys and environment-specific configurations. How would you manage this data securely in Kubernetes?



4. Resource Optimization and Scaling

Your application is experiencing high traffic. Describe how Kubernetes autoscaling works and how you would configure it to handle variable load.



5. Troubleshooting Failed Pods

A pod is stuck in CrashLoopBackOff state. Walk me through your troubleshooting steps to identify and resolve the issue.



6. Persistent Storage in Kubernetes

Describe how you would manage persistent storage for a stateful application running in Kubernetes. What options do you have for handling data storage and backups?



7. Network Policies

How would you implement network security in Kubernetes to control the communication between namespaces or restrict access to certain services?



8. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

When and why would you use a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) in Kubernetes? Can you describe a scenario where a CRD would be beneficial?



9. Multi-Cluster and Cross-Cluster Management

How would you manage an application deployment that spans multiple Kubernetes clusters? What considerations should you have for networking and consistency?



10. Application Monitoring and Logging

What are some of the best practices for monitoring and logging in Kubernetes? How would you set up observability for applications running on a cluster?


11. Handling Node Failures

How does Kubernetes handle node failures, and how would you ensure high availability for critical applications in case of node downtime?


12. Stateful Applications and StatefulSets

Describe a scenario where you would use a StatefulSet instead of a Deployment. What makes StatefulSets suitable for certain applications?


13. Ingress Configuration

How would you expose a web application to external users in Kubernetes? What are the main options for configuring an Ingress?


14. Pod Resource Management

How would you ensure that a pod doesn’t use more resources than allocated? Describe how resource requests and limits work in Kubernetes.

1. Cluster Management and Architecture

1. Scenario: Your Kubernetes control plane crashed. How would you investigate and restore the cluster?


2. Scenario: You need to set up a multi-node Kubernetes cluster with high availability. What architectural considerations will you take into account?


3. Scenario: One of your worker nodes is not joining the cluster. How would you debug the issue?

2. Networking and Ingress

4. Scenario: How would you expose multiple services using a single IP with different paths (e.g., /service1 and /service2)?


5. Scenario: A Pod cannot communicate with another Pod in a different namespace. How will you troubleshoot it?


6. Scenario: How would you restrict certain services to be accessible only within the cluster?




---

3. Storage Management

7. Scenario: Your application requires persistent storage. How would you configure it in Kubernetes?


8. Scenario: A Pod using a Persistent Volume gets stuck in the Pending state. What steps would you take to resolve the issue?


9. Scenario: How would you ensure data redundancy in a Kubernetes cluster?




---

4. Security and Access Control

10. Scenario: You need to allow a specific namespace to pull images from a private Docker registry. How would you configure it?


11. Scenario: How would you create and manage role-based access controls (RBAC) for multiple teams using the same Kubernetes cluster?


12. Scenario: A developer reports unauthorized access to a resource. How would you audit and secure the cluster?




---

5. Workload Management and Deployment Strategies

13. Scenario: How would you deploy an application in a rolling update fashion while minimizing downtime?


14. Scenario: You need to deploy a new version of an application but need the ability to quickly revert if there are issues. How would you implement this?


15. Scenario: If a Pod becomes unresponsive during deployment, how would you identify and resolve the problem?




---

6. Autoscaling and Resource Management

16. Scenario: How would you configure autoscaling for an application based on CPU and memory usage?


17. Scenario: Your application experiences unpredictable traffic spikes. How would you optimize resource allocation?


18. Scenario: What would you do if a Pod consumes more resources than allocated, causing other applications to slow down?




---

7. Monitoring and Logging

19. Scenario: How would you set up monitoring for the cluster and applications running on it?


20. Scenario: An application is running but is not behaving as expected. How would you collect logs for troubleshooting?


21. Scenario: How would you monitor the health of Kubernetes components and trigger alerts on failure?

1. Service Discovery in a Cluster

How would you set up communication between multiple microservices within the same Kubernetes cluster? How does Kubernetes manage service discovery for internal services?



2. Rolling Updates and Rollbacks

You’ve deployed a new version of an application, but it’s causing issues. Describe how you would perform a rollback in Kubernetes and what mechanisms exist to ensure zero downtime during deployments.



3. Managing Configurations and Secrets

Your application requires sensitive data like API keys and environment-specific configurations. How would you manage this data securely in Kubernetes?



4. Resource Optimization and Scaling

Your application is experiencing high traffic. Describe how Kubernetes autoscaling works and how you would configure it to handle variable load.



5. Troubleshooting Failed Pods

A pod is stuck in CrashLoopBackOff state. Walk me through your troubleshooting steps to identify and resolve the issue.



6. Persistent Storage in Kubernetes

Describe how you would manage persistent storage for a stateful application running in Kubernetes. What options do you have for handling data storage and backups?



7. Network Policies

How would you implement network security in Kubernetes to control the communication between namespaces or restrict access to certain services?



8. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

When and why would you use a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) in Kubernetes? Can you describe a scenario where a CRD would be beneficial?



9. Multi-Cluster and Cross-Cluster Management

How would you manage an application deployment that spans multiple Kubernetes clusters? What considerations should you have for networking and consistency?



10. Application Monitoring and Logging

What are some of the best practices for monitoring and logging in Kubernetes? How would you set up observability for applications running on a cluster?


11. Handling Node Failures

How does Kubernetes handle node failures, and how would you ensure high availability for critical applications in case of node downtime?


12. Stateful Applications and StatefulSets

Describe a scenario where you would use a StatefulSet instead of a Deployment. What makes StatefulSets suitable for certain applications?


13. Ingress Configuration

How would you expose a web application to external users in Kubernetes? What are the main options for configuring an Ingress?


14. Pod Resource Management

How would you ensure that a pod doesn’t use more resources than allocated? Describe how resource requests and limits work in Kubernetes.

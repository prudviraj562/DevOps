1. Implementing a CI/CD Pipeline

You need to build a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices-based application hosted on AWS. Describe the steps and tools you would use to automate the build, test, and deployment process. How would you ensure the pipeline is efficient and scalable?


2. Handling Failures in a Pipeline

What would you do if a deployment stage in your CI/CD pipeline fails midway? How do you ensure that such failures do not impact production?


3. Security in CI/CD

Your pipeline processes sensitive data like credentials. How would you secure these secrets throughout the CI/CD pipeline, and what tools would you use?


4. Automated Testing in CI/CD

How would you integrate unit, integration, and performance tests in your CI/CD pipeline? How do you ensure tests donâ€™t become a bottleneck in your delivery process?


5. Managing Multiple Environments

How would you deploy the same code to multiple environments (like dev, staging, and prod) using CI/CD pipelines? How do you ensure configuration differences are handled properly?


6. Pipeline Optimization for Faster Deployments

Your pipeline is taking too long to complete. What steps would you take to optimize its performance without compromising quality?


7. Monitoring and Troubleshooting CI/CD Pipelines

A release deployment failed, and the logs are inconclusive. What would your troubleshooting steps be? How would you improve pipeline observability for future runs?


8. Dealing with Dependencies in CI/CD Pipelines

You are working on a monorepo with multiple services, each with different dependencies. How would you set up your CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy only the affected services after a code change?


9. Implementing Blue-Green and Canary Deployments

Your team wants to minimize downtime and mitigate risks during production deployments. How would you implement blue-green or canary deployments in your pipeline? Which one would you choose for a high-traffic application?


10. Handling Versioning and Artifacts

How do you manage the versioning of builds and artifacts in a CI/CD pipeline? What practices do you follow to ensure traceability and consistency across deployments?

🔥 Top 🐧LINUX 🐧 Scenario Based Interview Questions 🔥 

1. File Permissions 💡

A developer is unable to execute a script, even though they are the owner. How would you diagnose and resolve this issue?


2. Process Management💡

A high CPU usage alert has been triggered for a process. How would you identify the process and reduce its CPU usage without terminating it?


3. Disk Space Issues💡

Your server is running out of disk space. How would you find out which files or directories are consuming the most space, and how would you free up space?


4. User Management💡

A new employee joins the team and needs access to the development environment. How would you create a new user, assign them to the correct group, and set the necessary permissions?


5. Network Configuration💡

You are unable to ping an external website from your Linux server. How would you troubleshoot this issue to identify if it's a DNS, routing, or firewall problem?


6. Package Management💡

You need to install a specific version of a package that is not available in your current repository. How would you install it and ensure it doesn't interfere with existing versions?


7. Shell Scripting💡

You need to automate the backup of log files daily. How would you write a script to compress all log files older than 7 days and move them to an archive directory?


8. System Monitoring💡

You suspect that the server is experiencing performance degradation. What Linux tools would you use to monitor system resources (CPU, memory, I/O) and identify the root cause?


9. Service Management💡

A critical service has failed and is not running. How would you diagnose why the service failed and configure it to automatically restart if it fails again?


10. File Search💡

You are looking for a specific configuration file containing the word “timeout” across multiple directories. How would you search for this file quickly?


11. Crontab Troubleshooting💡

A cron job you’ve scheduled to run a backup script daily is not executing as expected. How would you troubleshoot and fix this issue?


12. Kernel Updates💡

You need to update the kernel of a Linux server without causing prolonged downtime. How would you safely update the kernel and handle potential issues post-reboot?


13. File System Mounting💡

A filesystem has become read-only due to an error. How would you remount it and prevent this issue from happening in the future?


14. SSH Configuration💡

You need to securely configure SSH for remote access, disallowing root login but enabling key-based authentication for users. How would you achieve this?


15. Firewall Configuration💡

You need to allow traffic on a specific port for a service you are deploying. How would you configure the firewall to allow this port without disabling the firewall entirely?

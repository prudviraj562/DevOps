1.  Explain Docker image?

- A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that contains all the dependencies 
  (code, runtime, libraries, and environment variables) required to run an application. It serves as a template to create Docker containers.

2. How do Docker images and containers differ?

- A Docker image is a static, read-only template.
- A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image, which is mutable and can be executed.

3. How are layers used in Docker images?

- Docker images are made up of multiple layers,
  where each layer represents changes (like file additions or modifications). Layers are cached, which makes builds faster and reduces storage redundancy.

4. How do you create a Docker image?

- You can create a Docker image using a Dockerfile and the docker build command.
